PowerPoint presentations will be imported here as folders.

When you import a .pptx file:
1. Each slide is exported as a PNG image
2. A folder is created with the presentation name
3. All slide images are stored in that folder

You can view and manage your imported presentations from the Presentations section in PURE PRESENTER.
