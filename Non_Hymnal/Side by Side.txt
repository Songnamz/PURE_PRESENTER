Side by Side

Side by side we stand
Waiting God's command
Worshipping the saving King
Living by His grace
And moving out in faith
Jesus will see us through

Meet me in Heaven
We'll join hands together
Meet me by the Saviours' side
I'll meet you in Heaven
We'll sing songs together
Brothers and Sisters I'll be there

Soldiers all are we
To go where Jesus leads
To fight the foe and we will overcome
Heaven is our goal
To save every soul
Pray that we all will be there

Meet me in Heaven
We'll join hands together
Meet me by the Saviours' side
I'll meet you in Heaven
We'll sing songs together
Brothers and Sisters I'll be there

Meet me in Heaven
We'll join hands together
Meet me by the Saviours' side
I'll meet you in Heaven
We'll sing songs together
Brothers and Sisters I'll be there
